Library Management System
This Python program simulates a simple library management system. It supports different types of library items (novels, academic journals, magazines) and allows users to borrow, return, and retreive item information.

Classes
LibraryItem
Base class for all library items. It contains basic attributes like title, author, library ID, and publication year. Subclasses include Novel, AcademicJournal and Magazine.

LibraryUser
Users can borrow and return items. A list of held items is also available and can be called. The Librarian subclass is able to make changes to inventory by adding or removing items
